Small children may not be bright enough to look both ways before crossing a street, but many wild chimps are. Scientists observed a stretch of road in Uganda for 29 months. 112 chimpanzees crossed during that time. 92% of them checked for cars in at least one direction before crossing. Many checked both directions. Alpha makes were particularly vigilant, carefully organizing about 83% of the group crossings. The video below shows one alpha escorting a group across the road. He watches the progress of the stragglers while monitoring road traffic.
