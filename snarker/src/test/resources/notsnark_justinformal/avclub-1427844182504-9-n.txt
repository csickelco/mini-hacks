Fans of disturbingly violent espionage, smart metaphors for marriage, and unflattering, Reagan-era fashion have new reason to jointly celebrate. FX has announced that it’s renewing its critically acclaimed Cold War drama The Americans for a fourth season. The A.V. Club called the series the third best thing on television this past December, and it’s only gotten stronger since, perfecting its slow-burn mixture of spy games and domestic discord. With the season three finale still a month off, it’s tough to say where an additional 13 episodes might take the show, save that it will surely inch Philip and Elizabeth a little closer to the collapse of their motherland, and will also feature a lot of bitchin’ toupées. Personally, we’re just pulling for the mail robot to become a series regular.
