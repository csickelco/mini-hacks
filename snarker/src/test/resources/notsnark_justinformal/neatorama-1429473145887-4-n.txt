Kevin Spacey is constantly reinventing himself as an actor, tackling new roles with a zeal that proves he's in it for more than just the money- he has a need to succeed that stems from his dark family history.
According to Spacey's older brother Randall Fowler (who also happens to be a Rod Stewart impersonator) he and Kevin grew up under constant threat of assault from their American Nazi father Thomas Geoffrey Fowler.
Thomas allegedly physically and sexually abused Randall but left Kevin alone, and the emotional damage caused Kevin to cut off all ties with his father and take his mother's maiden name of Spacey.
This story first broke ten years ago, shortly after Randall was interviewed by Sharon Churcher and revealed details of his family's tragic history that were previously thought to be nothing but idle gossip.
I'm not sure why this story is making the rounds again but if you haven't heard Spacey's dark backstory it's news to you!
