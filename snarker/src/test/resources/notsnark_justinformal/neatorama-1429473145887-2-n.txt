Bushy Park , a Royal Park in southwestern London, is a lovely spot with trees, trails, and ponds. In one of those ponds, visitors recently reported seeing a hippopotamus. As hippopotami are terribly dangerous creatures--they kill more people in Africa than any other animal --park officials took notice. But they think that it's probably just a remote-controlled toy. George Odling quotes a park official in the Richmond and Twickenham Times :
He said: "We are unaware of specifically what it is other than we’ve had no reports of a hippo in the park...it’s probably remote controlled!"
Note that they're not saying this with certaintly.
