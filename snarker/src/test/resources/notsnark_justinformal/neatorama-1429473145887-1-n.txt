We showed you a wedding RSVP card last week that no one will ever use because it’s a snarky statement on horrible wedding guests. This is much more lighthearted. Redditor cloggingthetubes received this wedding RSVP form from a couple who have their sense of humor intact.
There doesn’t appear to be an option for people who can’t come, but the bride can get some really useful information from those who do. Those who are hoping to meet someone will all be seated at the same table(s) so they can. Anyone planning to propose at the reception will be given the wrong location (really, don’t do that). Imaginary children don’t have to be counted for catering. And nobody expects the Spanish Inquisition!
