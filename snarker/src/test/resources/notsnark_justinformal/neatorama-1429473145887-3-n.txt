Is there any more appropriate place to wear a Star Trek uniform than in outer space? That couldn’t have been easy, considering the limitations on how many belongings crew members are allowed to bring to the ISS. This is astronaut Samantha Cristoforetti , an Italian engineer from the European Space Agency (ESA) aboard the space station. For this picture, though, she is Captain Janeway from Star Trek: Voyager.
She’s pointing to the SpaceX Dragon capsule that was delivering supplies to the ISS Friday, and her text is referring to the coveted espresso machine aboard. They call it the ISSpresso. That is one necessary delivery for an Italian astronaut! -via Uproxx
