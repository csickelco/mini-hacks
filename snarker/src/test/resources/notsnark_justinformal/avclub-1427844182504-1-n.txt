Adewale Akinnuoye-Agbaje, the actor best known as either Mr. Eko from Lost, Adebisi from Oz, Algrim and Kurse from Thor: The Dark World, Nykwana Wombosi from The Bourne Identity, or simply, “You know, that guy. Damn it, I wish I could remember his name,” has just booked another high-profile supporting role. The British actor has been cast in DC’s upcoming Suicide Squad movie as Killer Croc, the scaly, sewer-dwelling underworld figure whose lust for power frequently puts him at odds with Batman and other assorted Gotham City do-gooders.
