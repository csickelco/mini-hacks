Robert Durst was denied bail at court in New Orleans today after a nearly three-hour hearing, ABC News reports . Today's hearing pertained to two weapons charges; a second bail hearing, on his arrest on the murder warrant issued by Los Angeles police, will follow.
An investigator with the Orleans Parish district attorney's office, James O'Hearne, told the court that, before his arrest, authorities had requested a warrant to monitor Durst's phone, The Los Angeles Times reports . According to ABC , prosecutors said they lost track of the phone somewhere between Houston and Beaumont, Texas.
They picked Durst up again when he placed two calls from a hotel phone to the voicemail on his personal phone, Reuters reports .
Here are some items that the police say they found in Durst's hotel room, per ABC News and The Los Angeles Times :
A flesh-toned latex mask "with salt-and-pepper hair"
More than $42,000 in cash
Four bags of marijuana (or "enough for about 300 joints," according to ABC)
A fake ID
