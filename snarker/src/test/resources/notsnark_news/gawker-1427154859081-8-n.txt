At a press conference this afternoon, Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy Longo announced that his department has suspended—but not closed—an investigation into an alleged gang rape at the University of Virginia, infamously detailed in a Rolling Stone article published last year. Longo said that the investigation uncovered "no evidence" to support claims made by a UVA student identified as "Jackie" in the article.
Longo was careful to emphasize that, while he found no evidence supporting Jackie's claims, he could not prove definitively that she wasn't sexually assaulted that night. He did, however, provide a long list of inconsistencies in Jackie's story, as told to the magazine: the Phi Kappa Psi fraternity house where the alleged assault took place didn't have a party the night Jackie claimed, police could find no record of  the man she claimed led the assault, and the layout of the frat varied from the one she provided to Rolling Stone.
Jackie also repeatedly refused to cooperate with the police investigation and did not provide a statement. Longo said that Jackie "absolutely" will not face charges for her involvement in the case.
Two weeks after it was published, Rolling Stone apologized for writer Sabrina Rubin Erderly's investigation and acknowledged "discrepancies in Jackie's account." UVA president Teresa A. Sullivan quickly suspended the Phi Kappa Psi frat following the  article's publication but reinstated the chapter in January after failing to find any "substantive" evidence to support Jackie's claims.
A complete review of the Rolling Stone article is expected from the Columbia University Graduate School of Journalism next month.
