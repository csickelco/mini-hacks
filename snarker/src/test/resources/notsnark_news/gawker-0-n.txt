According to today's announcement , the reassignment will begin next Monday and remain in effect until the state supreme court orders otherwise.
Arguing that "extraordinary action" was needed, Chief Justice Mary R. Russell said Judge Roy L. Richter of the Missouri Court of Appeals will bring "a fresh, disinterested perspective to this court's practices and he is able and willing to implement needed reforms."

The report said the city set defendants up to fail by requiring them to appear at a specific place and time to pay citations. Ferguson police officers frequently provided wrong information about when to appear in court, and the in-person appearance requirement "imposes particular difficulties on low-wage workers, single parents and those with limited access to reliable transportation."
