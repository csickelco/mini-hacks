Kristin Cavallari, whose debut book Balancing on Heels drops in 457 days, stopped by The Meredith Vieira Show today to promote not her book, but the idea of Kristin in general. Meredith Vieira, who is currently trailing Dr. Phil, Wendy Williams, and Steve Harvey in the daytime talk show ratings, welcomed her.
No doubt the two communed deeply in front of the studio audience, covering everything from historical trends in the Belarusian economy email scandal to Kristin's line of mid-priced shoes for Chinese Laundry, but we don't have to discuss all of that today. Since Vieira's show is apparently suffering so much as to require Kristin's appearance on it, we will dedicate the whole week to drawing attention to the event, as a humanitarian effort.
That's right: It's Meredith Vieira Week on 500 Days of Kristin. Meredith WEEK-eira. A one-week meditation on two gals forever linked by their fading personal brands and the opposite-colored piping on their office-appropriate ensembles.
What do you think Kristin thought when she first shook hands with Meredith backstage and realized what she was wearing? My guess is "fuck."
