Something—the sneaky finger of Jesus, perhaps—seems to have taken down the web page where His Holiness Pastor Creflo A. Dollar was asking followers to give him $65 million to buy a new private jet.
Though Jesus is, as always, the most likely culprit, it is possible that the good reverend himself took down the funding page today after reports of its existence in the secular media prompted many of ye with little faith to insinuate that this Man of God had done something wrong by appealing for $300 donations from 200,000 of his humble followers so that he could replace the old private jet he was using with a new private jet—a Gulfstream G650, billed as "the best private jet money can buy."
The old plane was old, you see. So Creflo, if I may call you that, Creflo, needed some way, any way, to continue to reach the lost souls of the world. "Believe it or not, there are still millions of people on this planet who have never heard of Jesus Christ and know nothing of His greatness," read the now-disappeared plea for $65 million. "Our hearts desire to see precious lives changed and snatched out of darkness and thrust into His marvelous light! We need your help to continue reaching a lost and dying world for the Lord Jesus Christ."
It's easy to mock Reverend Dollar, so please keep in mind that your mockery will be held to a higher quality standard than usual.
