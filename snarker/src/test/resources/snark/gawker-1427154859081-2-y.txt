Here's a story where everyone is bad and wrong: Lil Wayne showed up like 3 hours late to a show in Fort Lauderdale on Saturday night. Fans were understandably pissed that the headliner didn't go on until 3:30 a.m., but some of them handled it less punchably than this gentleman, who held up scrolling messages on his Apple Internet Phone in the direction of the stage.
"Shut the fuck up and put on Weezy," the first message, seen above, demanded. As the hour grew later and Wayne still hadn't arrived, he shortened it a bit: "Fuck Weezy," read the second message, according to TMZ .
"Punch me! Punch me!" read his punchable, bearded face, bobbing proudly atop a polo shirt with tongue lolling out.
The fan also allegedly threw a beer bottle at the stage .
When Weezy finally arrived, he appeared to point toward the young man, so desperate to be punched, and ask his security guards to go, y'know, punch him.
That happened, and you can see some additional photos of the aftermath at the Broward-Palm Beach New Times:
After chilling on one of the onstage couches for about 20 minutes, casually smoking and drinking with his crew while he waited for polo-beard to be socked and removed from the show, Lil Wayne finally grabbed the mic and performed approximately two and a half songs. He was not, contrary to the title of his most recent mixtape, sorry for the wait.
Tickets cost between $80 and $150.
Every participant in this situation is terrible.
