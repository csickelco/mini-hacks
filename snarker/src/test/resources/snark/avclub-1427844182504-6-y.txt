Even more rich, entitled people are coming to Bravo. The network has renewed four of its most popular series —Ladies Of London, Don’t Be Tardy…, Million Dollar Listing Los Angeles, and Manzo’d With Children—and okayed 10 new series, including Recipe For Deception, a cooking competition show hosted by comedian Max Silvestri, and NeNe And Kim: The Road To Riches, in which two of Atlanta’s Real Housewives go on a Simple Life-style trip across America.
The network is also expanding some of its other properties. Take, for example, Below Deck Mediterranean, which takes Bravo’s sleazy Below Deck and jets it over to Europe. Another new show, Apres Ski, sounds like Below Deck on ice, attempting to follow the “well-groomed staff” of a “luxurious concierge company” in Whistler, British Columbia. Other ostensibly tangential expansions include Ladies Of Dallas and Married To Medicine Houston.
Of course, there will also be shows about sexy people doing somewhat sexy jobs, like Fit Club, which follows “New York City’s hottest trainers” as they “compete for the same wealthy Manhattanites and famous celebrity clients,” not that any big-name celebrities will appear on the actual show, of course. As a press release from Bravo warns, “If [the trainers] can’t keep their romances, feuds, and professional jealousies in check, things could get physical.” Things will get physical, of course—if the trainers on the show behaved themselves like decent, professional adults, their show wouldn’t get renewed, and to be a failed and somewhat boring “Bravolebrity” is surely one of the worst fates known to man, save for maybe being boiled alive.
Other shows include Mother Funders, a show about the “ambitious suburban ladies of Locust Grove, Georgia’s Parent-Teacher Organization,” Tour Group, which seems like The Amazing Race without all the interesting competition, and My Fab 40th, which is sort of like My Super Sweet Sixteen, but for spoiled adults who should know better.
