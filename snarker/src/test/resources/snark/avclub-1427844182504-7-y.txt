Concluding Patton Oswalt’s three-year run of leading the Internet’s most prestigious circle jerk, Hannibal Buress will step in as host of the 2015 Webby Awards. The event’s 19th edition will take place on May 18 in New York City and stream online the next day at WebbyAwards.com . Because you’re reading this article on the Internet, you’re probably aware that Buress’ star has been rising lately—in addition to his recurring roles on Broad City and The Eric Andre Show, he’s always showing up in various corners of the web to review the experience of being on a boat , eviscerate hecklers , and perhaps most satisfyingly, put Justin Bieber in his place .
The guy clearly “gets it” when it comes to Internet humor and pop culture in general, so with Comedy Central finally realizing this truth and giving Buress his own show , it’s no surprise to see him sliding in as host of the Webbys. With any luck, he’ll show up drunk to the event like he did to play drums with Speedy Ortiz at SXSW . Either way, it should be just as blissfully cacophonous.
