You may have thought a psychiatric hold would stop the obsessed man who’s been stalking Ariana Grande and once sent her a 42-pound pumpkin , but no mere institution can hold his love.
TMZ revealed today that 29-year-old Tim Normandin didn’t give up on Lil Ari after he was busted back in December trying to sneak into her record label’s headquarters wearing a Santa suit and then held in a facility for four days. Nay, the man who once sent the itty-bitty poplet a bunch of Yankee candles and an anklet from Kay Jewelers was arrested yet again in March.
Normandin had traveled from his Lowell, Mass. home to Uncasville, Conn., where Ariana was playing the Mohegan Sun Arena, and attempted to get in and meet her. He was arrested for trespassing by the Mohegan Tribal Police and released on $5,000 bond.
On the same day, Normandin declared his undying amor for Ariana Grande—who was still with her jealous rapper boyfriend Big Sean at the time—in a poem on Facebook.
He’s made his profile private since then, but the Daily Mail reports that Normandin expressed sadness that Grande had rejected, “all my love, my care, and my worth / This greatest love I give,” and wondered whether he was worth “more than dirt” to her.
Ariana is very busy and doesn’t have time to deal with this kind of thing, so I have taken the liberty of composing a response on her behalf. It was difficult without access to the entirety of his original work, but I feel it addresses the general ideas contained therein.
Ahem.
