Like a song you cannot get out of your head no matter how hard you try, its chorus forever returning to your idle mind—"Staaay with me / 'Cause you're...all-I-need"—Jamie Dornan just cannot stop telling interviewers that he and Dakota Johnson had chemistry and also that he is a father and a husband too, and do you know that his wife is actually fine with 50 Shades?

Though the press tour for 50 Shades of Grey ended about a month ago, Jamie Dornan was interviewed recently in the Daily Mail , where he stuck strictly to his talking points, thank goodness. For example, is his wife mad at him for being in 50 Shades of Grey?
"Of course she would have read the scripts well in advance, and she's massively supportive of Fifty Shades."
Is he a father and a husband, and does that make it somewhat weird for him to be in 50 Shades of Grey—a movie that includes sex with someone other than his wife?
"I'm just a father and a husband, really," he said. "I wouldn't have been in the conversation for Fifty Shades without The Fall."
Speaking of 50 Shades, does he think that he and Dakota had chemistry?
"They wouldn't have shot the film with us if there was a chemistry problem... whatever chemistry means. You have to jump through a lot of hoops to get a part like this, and they simply wouldn't have cast us."
Cool. Glad we had this time to catch up!
