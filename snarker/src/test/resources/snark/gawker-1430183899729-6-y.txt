Elle Macpherson, an “Australian businesswoman, television host, model, and actress,” sure, if you say so, carries urine testers in her purse. Don’t believe me? Hah! She said it herself!
“I don’t believe you,” you’re thinking. “Why would Elle Macpherson, a woman I am familiar with from her work as an Australian businesswoman, television host, model, and actress, carry urine testers in her purse? You expect me to believe that she does, just because you say it? You must be crazy.” I don’t, and I’m not. Like I said before: She said it herself.
Here she is, from Page Six , about the most shocking thing she has in her purse:
“A pH balance urine tester kit to check that I’m in an alkaline state.”
See? It’s to check if she’s in an alkaline state. (And she wants to check if she’s in an alkaline state because she “believe[s] that most ailments come from having an acidic body,” which you could have assumed.)
See?
