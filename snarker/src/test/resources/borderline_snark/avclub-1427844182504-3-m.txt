It has been a busy week for David Duchovny. First came the news that Fox will bring back The X-Files for a six-episode run, with series creator/executive producer Chris Carter on board as well as Duchovny and Gillian Anderson, who will reprise their roles as Fox Mulder and Dana Scully. Since then, the announcement has been all any truth-seekers can talk about—including Jeremy Egner at The New York Times, who used an interview with Duchovny that was supposed to be about the actor’s new project Aquarius to talk all things X-Files. (In ever-so-slightly less buzzworthy news, Duchovny may also reprise his role as Denise Bryson in the Twin Peaks continuation set for 2016.)
In other words, it’s a very busy time for Duchovny. But he has apparently decided to one-up himself by hitting the studio to record an album , of all things. Duchovny’s debut solo album Hell Or Highwater, which will include 12 original songs written by the actor-writer-singer, will hit stores on May 12. The album, which, according to a press release, is “firmly embedded in [Duchovny’s] uniquely lyrical, troubadour style,” will be released via ThinkSay Records and distributed via the Caroline/Universal Music Group.
No one really knew Duchovny has been walking this planet with a uniquely lyrical, troubadour style, but I guess we’re about to find out exactly what that means, as the title track is now available on Amazon and iTunes . Many fans probably don’t know about Duchovny’s musical aspirations, to which Double D himself replies simply, “I sing.” He did also write a book about a cow trying to bring peace to Israel and Palestine, so at this point, nothing should be surprising.
