The Rolling Stones are taking their creaky yet still somehow functional selves out on the road . The 15-date Zip Code tour hits a number of North America’s best corporate-sponsored stadiums this summer, including San Diego’s Petco Park and Pittsburgh’s Heinz Field. (Louisville’s KFC Yum! Center and Sacramento’s Sleep Train Arena must not have been available.)
A full rundown of dates is below, though residents of major markets like Chicago, New York, Los Angeles, and San Francisco won’t find that much to get excited about.
